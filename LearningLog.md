- In React, set state vars for all parts of a form, then another state var that bundles the snapshots of the others upon form submit
- dynamic imports return a promise
- `this` inside a function is a different reference from `this` outside it
- Call a function with the `data` returned from a `fetch` call (and `.json` parse) promises to break that data workflow out separately in the script (instead of trying to assign it to a global variable)
